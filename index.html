        <p>I have frequently seen people become neurotic when they content themselves with inadequate or wrong answes to
          the questions of life. They seek position, marriage, reputation, outward success of money, and remain unhappy
          and neurotic even when they have attained what they were seeking. Such people are usually confined within too
          narrow a spiritual horizon. Their life has not sufficient content, sufficient meaning. If they are enabled to
          develop into more spacious personalities, the neurosis generally disappears.</p>
        <p>Be silent and listen: have you recognized your madness and do you admit it? Have you noticed that all your
          foundations are completely mired in madness? Do you not want too recognize your madness and welcome it in a
          friendly manner? Youu wanted to accept everything. So accept madness too. Let the light of your madness shine,
          and it will suddenly dawn on you. Madness is not to be despised and not to be feared, but instead you should
          give it life... If you want to find paths, you should also not spurn madness, since it makes up such a great
          part of your nature.... Be glad that you can recognize it, for you will thus avoid becoming its victim.
